Hacking on A.I, AIoT, distributed and embedded systems, machine learning, robotics and streaming media

### Working on

- [**Aiko Services**](https://github.com/geekscape/aiko_services) a distributed embedded framework, which integrates the domains of AIoT, Machine Learning, Media Streaming and Robotics

- [**Aiko Engine MP**](https://github.com/geekscape/aiko_engine_mp) an implementation of Aiko Services that supports embedded devices running [microPython](https://micropython.org)

### Projects
