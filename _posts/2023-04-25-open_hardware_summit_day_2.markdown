_Previous day:
[Open Hardware Summit trek in New York: Monday 2023-04-24](open-hardware-summit-day-1)_

_Fast-forward to:
[Open Hardware Summit Day 1 and NoiseBridge: Friday 2023-04-28](open-hardware-summit-day-5)_

After much anticipation and some relief, the adventure can begin ...
but, wait ... there are just a couple of things to sort out first !
Checking into the hotel is easy, but the room won't be ready until 2 pm.
So, no shower yet ... sigh ðŸ˜”

_To be completed: First day, settling into New York, New York !
Technically, this is the third day of travel :)_
