_Fast-forward to:
[Open Hardware Summit Day 1 and NoiseBridge: Friday 2023-04-28](open-hardware-summit-day-5)_

After [Melbourne's extended CoVID-19 lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Victoria),
finally having the opportunity to travel overseas again was too good to pass up.
Especially when it was a chance to meet open hardware hackers in-person
at the [Open Hardware Summit 2023](https://2023.oshwa.org) in New York.
Always good to learn and bring back useful new ideas for Melbourne's
[Connected Community HackerSpace](https://www.hackmelbourne.org).

A huge bonus was travelling with [Steph Piper](https://www.makerqueen.com.au),
discussing and seeing her latest projects close-up, like
[Glow Stitch](https://www.makerqueen.com.au/glowstitch-project-showcase).
Steph has strong connections with other amazing people in the broader
craft Maker community.
Really looking forward to meeting a new and different group of creative people.
_Spoiler alert: I was not going to be disappointed !_

Long-distance travel is like a muscle, if you don't exercise it regularly,
it can take some practice to regain your stamina, especially for a long
flight.  Leaving Melbourne at 5:30 pm on a Monday evening and arriving
in New York at 7:30 am on a Tuesday morning doesn't sound too bad.

Until factoring in two airport transits 
([Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport) and
[Honolulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_K._Inouye_International_Airport)),
crossing 14 hours of timezones and the international dateline (Monday happened
twice).  Even rebuilding tolerance for sitting in close proximity with lots of
people takes time, especially after the isolation of lockdown.

Flying over the mighty
[Murrumbidgee River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murrumbidgee_River),
near Dog Trap Crossing, provides an excellent view of
[north-east](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holt,_Australian_Capital_Territory)
[Canberra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra).

After 20 hours of flight time, which was over 30 hours of real-time ...
[Manhattan island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan)
 is beckoning.  It was morning peak hour traffic traffic and the journey from
[JFK international airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport)
via the
[Queens Midtown Tunnel (QMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens%E2%80%93Midtown_Tunnel)
to the hotel in the
[East Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Village%2C_Manhattan)
takes about an hour to cover the 17 miles (27 kilometres).
Yep, an average of 9 MPH (14 KPH) ... you can nearly run that fast !

The taxi provided the cost up-front, like an Uber, of US$70 plus extras, which
came to US$82 (AUS$127) all up.

It is a real eye-opener traveling through the
[boroughs of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City),
each with their own distinct culture and socioeconomic make-up.
There are many recognizable landmarks along the way.  For example, the
[New York State Pavillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Pavilion), which was built for the
[1964 New York World's Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair),
which contains the [Unisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisphere) and the
Observation Towers.  These are often seen in movies, like
[Men In Black](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654).

As we approach the Queens Midtown Tunnel (QMT), the
[Empire State Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building)
is just briefly visible (above) ... and the end of the journey is close now.

Technically, the long Monday finished roughly 9 hours ago and Tuesday morning
has truly begun.  However, our minds perceive the world in unexpected ways
and my brain is finally saying that Monday is done and dusted !

Distance walked: 6.8 km
